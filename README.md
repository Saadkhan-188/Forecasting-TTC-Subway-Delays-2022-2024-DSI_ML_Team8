## 🧭 Overview

This project explores the [TTC Subway Delay Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data/) provided by the Toronto Transit Commission. By applying machine learning techniques and visual analytics, our team will identify patterns and potential predictive signals for subway delays, focusing on time-based features and operational categories.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this sprint, we aim to:

1. Apply technical skills across EDA, regression, time series modeling, and Git collaboration  
2. Build a portfolio-ready, reproducible data science project  
3. Work collaboratively using GitHub, Notion, and Slack  
4. Communicate results clearly through a README, visualizations, and a final presentation

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: [TTC Subway Delay Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data/)
- **Publisher**: Toronto Transit Commission  
- **Last Refreshed**: June 30, 2025  
- **Description**: Monthly delay logs across TTC subway lines including time, location, delay cause, duration, and other metadata  
- **Goal**: Identify delay trends, engineer time-based features, and evaluate predictive models for delay classification or duration estimation
